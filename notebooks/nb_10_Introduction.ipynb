First and foremost, it is very general - allowing us to specify the goal of control equally well for fully- or under-actuated, linear or nonlinear, deterministic or stochastic, and continuous or discrete systems. Second, it permits concise descriptions of potentially very complex desired behaviours, specifying the goal of control as a scalar objective (plus a list of constraints)."
